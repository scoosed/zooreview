                <article class="prose">
                    <p>
                        Hey there rollers! Welcome back to my blog. Today we will be reviewing adelaide zoo, and lets be real for a second. Having to use a wheelchair everyday is not very fun. But planning a day out, ooh boy. It comes with a whole extra layer of stress and support needed (and a lot of research!). My name's Alex, I'm 20 years old, and thanks to congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), my wheels have been my legs for 20 years. My biggest fear? Getting stranded (which happens a lot) and finding out their idea of "accessible" is a single ramp next to a flight of stairs. Yeah mate, not good.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Adelaide Zoo website makes a claim on their website: "Our walkways and trails are accessible for individuals with wheelchairs, please refer to the map key to familiarise yourself with the location of the only stair case within the zoo." I've been burned by those words before. After seeing mixed reviews online about high prices and crowds, I decided it was time to go see for myself and report back. So, here's the real story.

                        <h3>Accessibility: ★★★★★ (Amazing)</h3>
                        <p>Let's just say they weren't lying on their website. This is by far the most accessible major attraction I've ever been to in my life. Smooth, wide paths that lead everywhere. Seriously. I don't think there was a single place I couldnt access, which was amazing for once, especially because I am used to missing out on a lot of activities and fun elsewhere. And it doesnt stop there; The viewing areas. I wasn't staring at a brick wall or the back of someone's knees for once. Most enclosures have low fences or huge glass panels right down to the ground. Getting to see a Sumatran Tiger at eye level was epic, I loved it. Plus, they accepted my Companion Card without any hassle, which is a huge win for affordability. (and another claim they kept from their website)</p>

                        <h3>Atmosphere & Environment: ★★★☆☆ (Peaceful)</h3>
                        <p>The gardens were decently gorgeous, and honestly, it was surprisingly peaceful when I went. We went on a weekday and at times it almost felt like we had the place to ourselves. Navigating the special paths was a breeze, and it had a really calm, relaxing vibe. The only downside to this peacefulness is that the zoo feels a bit small and simple compared to others I've been to. It's mostly one big garden, lacking the diverse biomes like a designated ice zone or a large savanna area that you might see at bigger zoos. So while it's a lovely, quiet escape, it might not have the atmosphere of a larger, more varied zoo.</p>

                        <h3>Animal Welfare & Condition: ★★★★☆ (Happy)</h3>
                        <p>You can tell the animals are the priority here. While some of the older enclosures aren't as flashy or modern, the whole zoo is based on the vintage and old architecture, they were all packed with enrichment and things to keep the animals busy. All of the animals looked healthy and actively looked after. It really feels like they're focused on conservation and ethical treatment, which is very awesome to see. You leave feeling good about the care they're receiving.</p>

                        <h3>Value for Money: ★★☆☆☆ (Ouch)</h3>
                        <p>This is where it gets painful. The entry fee is seriously steep. For that kind of money, you expect a flawless experience, and it just wasn't. Finding out the nocturnal house was closed for the day (without a heads-up when booking) was a real letdown. Add in the crazy-expensive food, and it becomes a ridiculously expensive day. It's tough to say it's 'worth it' when the cost is that high.</p>

                        <h3>Food & Amenities: ★★★☆☆ (Cash Grab)</h3>
                        <p>The food is decent, but it is stupidly expensive (like any "convenient" cash grab). There are plenty of toilets, and I found the accessible stalls to be spacious and clean, which was a big relief. But back to the food. This is the main drawback. It's standard kiosk food quality at inflated prices. Heck, you could make something better in an air fryer. My advice? Pack lunch. Trust me, I was tired and hungry only a few hours in, and I wasn't even walking! My sharp eyes caught endless amounts of beautiful, shaded potential picnic spots, most of them wheelchair-accessible aswell. The <strong>facilities</strong> are there, but bringing your own food is essential to manage the insane cost of inflation (yay).</p>

                        <h3>Educational Value: ★★☆☆☆ (Boring)</h3>
                        <p>The info is there, but it's not presented very well. A lot of the signs were too high or at a weird angle for me to read comfortably from my chair. And trying to hear a keeper talk over a massive crowd? Forget about it. I couldn't get close enough to see or hear anything. It feels like a missed opportunity to make learning truly interactive and accessible for everyone.</p>

                <!-- The Verdict -->

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-4">So, What's The Verdict?</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-center text-gray-700">Look, if your main concern is physical accessibility like me, Adelaide Zoo is a dream. You'll have a rare, stress-free day where you can actually go everywhere. But it's a trade-off. You're paying a premium price for a day that can be stressful and crowded. My advice? Go, but go prepared. Pack your own lunch, aim for the quietest day you can find, and know that while your wheels will have an easy time, your wallet will not.</p>
